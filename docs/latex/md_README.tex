A Fibonacci word is a specific sequence of binary digits (or symbols from any two-\/letter alphabet). The Fibonacci word is formed by repeated concatenation in the same way that the Fibonacci numbers are formed by repeated addition. But unlike the fibonacci number, Fibonacci word has its first two terms different from each other. Example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{In Fibonacci word,}
\DoxyCodeLine{  F1 = "a",}
\DoxyCodeLine{  F2 = "b",}
\DoxyCodeLine{  F3 = "ab",}
\DoxyCodeLine{  F4 = "bab",}
\DoxyCodeLine{  F5 = "abbab",}
\DoxyCodeLine{  F6 = "bababbab", }
\DoxyCodeLine{  F7 = "abbabbababbab".}
\DoxyCodeLine{   ..... }
\end{DoxyCode}


where F(n) = F(n-\/2) + F(n-\/1) and + represents the concatenation of strings.~\newline

We are gonna use a {\ttfamily fibonacci-\/word.\+cc} file that contains our program (check \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html}{\texttt{ Google Style}}, a {\ttfamily string vector} that cointains all data from the input file and a {\ttfamily seed vector} that contains our info to generate Fibonaccis words. The programm should check all data from the {\ttfamily string vector} and write the process into an ouput file where the program will write if a {\ttfamily word} is or not a {\ttfamily Fibonacci word} and how many iteratotions we needed to generate that world.
